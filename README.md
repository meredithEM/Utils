OSDataReader_Feko
Description
OSDataReader_Feko is a Python script designed to read OS format files generated by the Feko software, extract specified data sections, transform them into Pandas DataFrames, and convert the DataFrames into PyTorch tensors for further processing. The script supports both parallel and serial reading modes for efficient file processing, and includes functions to check the number of samples in a directory and save the resulting tensors to disk.

Installation
To use this script, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas

numpy

torch

concurrent.futures

You can install them using pip:


pip install pandas numpy torch

To use the OSDataReader_Feko script, you need to provide the following parameters:

files_path: The path to the directory containing the OS files to be read.

samples_num: The expected number of samples in the directory.

model_name: The name of the model used to filter and name the output files.

read_mode: The mode for reading files, either 'parallel' for parallel processing or 'serial' for sequential processing.

Here's an example usage:

from osdatareader_feko import OsDataReader_Feko

# Set the parameters
files_path = '/path/to/os/files'
samples_num = 100
model_name = 'my_model'
read_mode = 'parallel'  # or 'serial' for sequential processing

# Call the function
OsDataReader_Feko(files_path, samples_num, model_name, read_mode)
Functionality
The script provides the following key functionalities:

File Reading: Reads OS files using the specified keywords to locate the start of the data section and skips a specified number of lines to extract the relevant data.

Data Extraction: Extracts the desired data from the files and converts them into Pandas DataFrames for further manipulation.

Sample Number Check: Checks the number of samples in the directory based on the file suffixes and model name, and compares it with the expected number of samples. If any samples are missing, it prints a warning message.

Data Transformation: Transforms the DataFrames into PyTorch tensors by selecting specific columns and converting them to the desired data type.

Parallel Processing: Supports parallel processing using the concurrent.futures library to improve file reading performance when dealing with a large number of files.

Tensor Saving: Saves the resulting tensors to disk in the specified directory using PyTorch's torch.save function, allowing for easy loading and reuse in future projects.
